### Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique? (1 line)
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you understand a topic by explaining it in very simple words, as if you are teaching it to a beginner, and then fixing the parts you don’t understand clearly.

### Question 2: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
One of the most interesting ideas in the video was how the brain works using the Pinball Metaphor. It explains that our thoughts move differently based on how focused or relaxed we are.
Another interesting story was about Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison, who used a simple trick involving holding keys or metal balls while resting. When they started falling asleep, the objects would drop and wake them up, helping them capture creative ideas from that relaxed state.

### Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active (Focused) Mode:
This mode is used when we concentrate deeply on a task we already have some knowledge about. Thinking follows clear and well-used paths in the brain.
Diffuse Mode:
This is a relaxed thinking mode where the mind is free to wander. It helps in understanding new topics, solving hard problems, and coming up with creative ideas.

### Question 4: According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? (Points only)
* Break the topic into small and manageable parts
* Learn just enough to identify mistakes on your own
* Use a limited number of learning resources
* Remove distractions before practicing
* Practice consistently for around 20 hours

### Question 5: What actions can you take to improve your learning process going forward?
*Apply the Feynman Technique*:
After learning something new, I will explain it in simple words to check my understanding.

*Use Time Blocks for Focus*:
I will study in short, focused sessions with breaks to avoid burnout and distractions.

*Switch Thinking Modes When Stuck*:
If I am stuck on a problem, I will take a short break and allow my brain to process the problem naturally.
